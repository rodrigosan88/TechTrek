Welcome to TechTrek, a revolutionary new gamification platform for the tech industry. Set in a distant galaxy, our platform provides a fun and engaging way for players to train and prepare for careers in engineering and IT.

# The Story
It is the year 2050, and humanity has made great strides in technology and space exploration. A group of brilliant scientists and engineers have come together to create TechTrek, a platform that combines gaming and technology in a way never seen before.

You'll face different aliens that represent the different types of problems and bugs that engineers and IT professionals have to deal with on a daily basis.

As you progress through the levels, you'll unlock new technologies and tools that will help you in your future career. The game is designed to be challenging, but also fun and engaging, and it simulates real-world scenarios that you'll encounter in the tech industry. The more you learn and progress, the more prepared you'll be to face the challenges of the future.
